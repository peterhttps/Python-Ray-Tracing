## Introduction
A repo to learn how Ray tracing algorithms works and how to implement them. 
Choosed Python for start and soon it will be rewrited on a more low level language.

Not I have other [repo](https://github.com/peterhttps/Rust-Ray-Tracing) with ray tracer written in Rust. 

`Feel free to contribute`

## Overview
- [x] Output an image
- [x] Casting rays into the scene
- [x] Adding sphere and ray create a ray traced image
- [x] Shading with surface normals
- [x] Listing hitable objects
- [x] Creating objects with full reflection
- [x] Antialiasing
- [ ] Improving data structure
- [ ] Adding difuse materials
- [ ] Lambertian Reflection
- [ ] Metalic objects

- Utils
- [ ] Organize code

Ray Tracing algorithm implemented in Python. 
Main logic comes of book [Ray Tracing in one Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) and playlist [Programação Dinâmica - Computação Gráfica](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5TJqBvpXQv5zNlgvgH2HGuhZHpnkT3oo)
